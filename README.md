# Archstall
Minimal Arch Linux install script.

## Usage
To use the script, just run 

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerMan2206/archstall/master/archstall > archstall
chmod +x archstall
./archstall
```

from a booted Arch live environment. It'll download the script, make it executable, and run it. Follow the instructions and you're golden.

## why
Well I don't like other Arch installers so I just made this.

## development
*"what do you mean development this is literally just two scripts-"* shshshshut, shut up. If you want to help with this, feel free to slap on a PR. I tested this many times in a VM, but there still might be some bugs. Opening an issue helps a lot!
